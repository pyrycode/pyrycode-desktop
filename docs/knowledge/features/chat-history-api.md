# Protected chat history — API and operations

Part of [Protected local chat history](chat-history.md). The fixed IPC surface and
main-process handler authorize saved-host operations independently of connection.

## API

[`src/shared/chatHistory.ts`](../../../src/shared/chatHistory.ts) defines
`ChatHistorySnapshot`, `DurableThreadItem`, `ChatHistoryRequest` and
`ChatHistoryResult`, plus the pure `parseChatHistorySnapshot` and
`parseChatHistoryRequest` validators. Shared code imports no renderer implementation.

[`createChatHistoryStore({ secureStore, log })`](../../../src/main/chatHistoryStore.ts)
returns `execute(request: unknown): Promise<ChatHistoryResult>`.
[`createChatHistoryHandler({ store, pairedServers, log })`](../../../src/main/chatHistoryHandler.ts)
returns an injected listener `(event: unknown, request: unknown)` with the same
result. It validates and copies the request synchronously, then checks
`pairedServers.loadById(serverId)` for existence before accessing chat storage.
Saved hosts are eligible while disconnected or pairing-rejected; a live
connection is never consulted.
The store validates independently but has no pairing dependency, so saved-host
authorization belongs to the handler. Pairing records are reduced to membership,
never forwarded to the caller.

[`src/main/index.ts`](../../../src/main/index.ts) registers one handler over one
store for the app lifetime, sharing the existing secure store and paired-server
store. Preload exposes `window.pyry.chatHistory(request): Promise<ChatHistoryResult>`
on the fixed `pyry:chat-history` channel; `PyryApi` carries its type into the window.
Reads and replacements need no handshake.

The callable handler also exposes main-only `clearServer(serverId, clearCredentials)`.
The composition root supplies it to the existing unpair handler: credential erasure
and protected `removeServer` run in the same queue as history membership checks and
storage operations. Earlier admitted work finishes before removal. Each history
request captures a host generation at admission; a matched credential erase advances
that generation before releasing the queue, even if history cleanup fails. Requests
queued behind removal with the old generation return `unknown-host`, including after
same-server re-pairing. Fresh requests still require saved-host membership. Calling
renderer `removeServer` after erasing credentials cannot replace this coordination:
it would fail membership validation.

A credential erase that throws or matches no record leaves history and the generation
untouched. After a matched erase, cleanup failure or a thrown cleanup error preserves
the successful credential outcome, so label cleanup, connection teardown and the
unpaired-state transition continue. `history-unpair-cleanup` records only static
`ok` or `failed`; successful unpair alone does not establish successful history deletion.
Successful cleanup removes the list and every timeline for that `server` identity,
including omitted timelines, while preserving other hosts' equal conversation ids.

Every request has `operation` and `serverId`. Additional fields are operation-specific:

| Operation | Additional fields | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `readList` | None | Read the host's ordered list snapshot. |
| `replaceList` | `snapshot` of kind `list` | Replace that list; timelines omitted from it remain saved. |
| `readTimeline` | `conversationId` | Read the addressed timeline. |
| `replaceTimeline` | `conversationId`, `snapshot` of kind `timeline` | Replace that timeline in full, preserving supplied row order. |
| `removeConversation` | `conversationId` | Atomically remove its timeline and its entry from the host's saved list. |
| `removeServer` | None | Remove every snapshot for that host, including timelines absent from its latest list. |

Unknown request keys, malformed snapshots, a wrong snapshot kind, or mismatched
snapshot/request coordinates produce `invalid-request` before any record access.
Callers cannot supply a storage path or blob name. Snapshot schema extensions are
discarded on projection rather than rejected; declared tool `input` remains a
string-to-string map with its supplied keys.
