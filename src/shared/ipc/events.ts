// The session-lifecycle members reuse a wire payload type from ../wire/types verbatim; the

// category enum — never a token, key, raw frame, or bundle bytes. AC4 is enforced by
// construction: no member has a field that could hold a secret (QrPayload/HelloClientPayload
// tokens, InnerFrameV2 bytes are not referenced here), so a developer cannot serialize one
// onto this channel.
//
// Imported by src/main and src/preload, which have no @shared path alias — hence the
// relative import here and in those callers (see tsconfig.node.json).
