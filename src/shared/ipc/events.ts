 * validated wire envelopes upstream). Never carries a token, key, raw frame, or bundle bytes
 * (AC4): the session members reuse only wire payload types, the debug-bundle members carry
 * only a count, a local path, and the closed DebugBundleFailure enum, and `snapshotReceived`
 * (#180) carries the three session-settings fields plus two usage ints (#191) — five fields, a
 * DEDICATED minimal shape, deliberately NOT reusing ScreenSnapshotPayload, so the sensitive
 * rendered-screen `text` can never ride this channel. Session member and field names mirror
 * SessionAction's so #19's mapping is near-identity, while the two unions stay separately declared
